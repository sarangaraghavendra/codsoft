                <h3>Image Classifier using CNN</h3>
                <p>Machine Learning is now one of the hottest topics around the world. Well, it can even be said of the new electricity in today’s world. But to be precise what is Machine Learning, well it’s just one way of teaching the machine by feeding a large amount of data. To know more about Machine learning and its algorithms you can refer to some links that are provided in the Reference sections of this article.

Today, we will create an Image Classifier of our own that can distinguish whether a given pic is of a dog or cat or something else depending upon your fed data. To achieve our goal, we will use one of the famous machine learning algorithms out there which are used for Image Classification i.e. Convolutional Neural Network(or CNN). 

So basically what is CNN – as we know it’s a machine learning algorithm for machines to understand the features of the image with foresight and remember the features to guess whether the name of the new image is fed to the machine. Since it’s not an article explaining CNN so I’ll add some links in the end if you guys are interested in how CNN works and behaves. 
So after going through all those links let us see how to create our very own cat-vs-dog image classifier.</p>
